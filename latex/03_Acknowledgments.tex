I thank my advisor, Dr. Neil Palumbo and thesis readers, Dr. Cleon Davis and Gregg Harrison, for their time, advice, recommendations, guidance and patience in completing this thesis.  Throughout this project, key insights into classical optimal control techniques and robustness analyses were provided to me in a number of formats (seminal journal/conference papers, textbooks, and slide decks), all of which proved invaluable in developing my understanding of the bigger picture in multivariable control design.  The experience gained in this thesis has highlighted and connected several topics within control theory which were previously only vaguely familiar, and helped put into context many practical aspects of solving control problems using numerical optimization.

I also thank General Dynamics for supporting this degree.  Certainly, my initial interest in adaptive and self-tuning feedback control stemmed from my work at the Bluefin Robotics site in Quincy, MA, and was further developed by graduate coursework from Johns Hopkins University's Whiting School of Engineering in digital control (MECH 535.645), autonomous vehicles (ECE 525.661), state estimation (ECE 525.745), mathematical methods (AP 615.641), reinforcement learning (ECE 525.637) and intelligent algorithms (ECE 525.770).
